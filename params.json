{"name":"Pejman Yousefzadeh","tagline":"Scribbling, scribbling, scribbling on the Internet.","body":"### Call Me Pejman\r\n\r\n_And you may ask yourself, “well, how did I get here?”_\r\n\r\n–Talking Heads, _Once in a Lifetime._\r\n\r\nPejman Yousefzadeh is a lawyer in the Chicagoland area. He has a weakness for discussions of law, politics, policy in general, economics, and philosophy. He also loves reading, blogging, chess, Go (though to call Pejman an amateur at Go is to overly praise his abilities), classical, baroque, romantic, and jazz music (especially the works of Mozart, Bach, and Handel), the Chelsea Blues, and all Chicago sports teams . . . except for the White Sox, who serve as a collective affront to civilized and cosmopolitan sensibilities.\r\n\r\nConcerning the eternal battle of the bands between the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, Pejman has sided with the Stones, as would any man of wealth and taste. Well, taste anyway.\r\n\r\nPejman has been denounced by the North Koreans. [Kinda](http://pejmanyousefzadeh.net/2015/08/27/i-have-arrived/).\r\n\r\nIn his spare time, Pejman may be found obsessing over the plot inconsistencies, subpar acting, and poor dialogue found in the Star Wars saga, not to mention criticizing in excruciating detail the many disastrous military decisions made by both Rebel and Imperial leaders.\r\n\r\nPejman is a graduate of the [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools](http://ucls.uchicago.edu/), the University of Chicago ([AB](http://www.uchicago.edu/) ’94, Political Science; [AM](http://cir.uchicago.edu/) ’95, International Relations), and [Pepperdine University School of Law](http://law.pepperdine.edu/).\r\n\r\nHis superpowers include book-purchasing, and hypergraphia. His weaknesses include a general inability to resist caffeinated products, a pronounced fondness for all things geeky, a lust for power, wealth, and glory, and a periodic tendency to refer to himself in the third person.\r\n\r\nIf, for whatever bizarre reason, you actually want more information, click [here](http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2011/01/the-normblog-profile-379-pejman-yousefzadeh.html).\r\n\r\n© Copyright: PEJMAN YOUSEFZADEH.
